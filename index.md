[My linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petru-niculescu/).

I am a young aspiring Penetration Tester & Cyber Security student looking for an internship or Junior role in Penetration testing, Governance, Risk, Compliance (GRC) & Cyber Analysis.

# My experience

I have acquired key non-technical skills during my 6 month experience as a GRC Consultant at MonetiseMe.co that I am more than ready to transfer to protect **your organisation**.

While I do lack experience in the **technical** world of Cyber Security, I have gone through countless labs simulating real-world environments whether it is being in the Blue Team in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate or in Offensive security with the TryHackMe Jr. Penetration Tester Certification.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```
